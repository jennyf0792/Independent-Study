# Entry 1: Introduction
### Github Tutorial Project

I searched through the links on gDocs that Mr. Mueller provided the class with to see what I wanted to independently study on my own and create a tutorial to share what I've learned. Within the first few links, I saw Twitterbot and I decided I wanted to learn more about Ruby and create an automated bot that generates tweets

## Motivation

Since I am actively on Twitter, I decided chatterbot would be nice for me because sometimes, I post random things on my feed. I thought it would be cool to have a bot to automatically generate tweet texts for me. I want to create a simple tutorial for others to understand to make what I will be making.

## Twitter On The Go! / First Attempt

I tried running the application to see whether I can get the Twitter account's replies or information; I want to be able to send an automated reply to any of the tweets that my account have made or someone else.

- Tested out random methods to see what my purpose of this project will be. Methods such as 'search' to perform search on Twitter
``` 
    search("potato") do |tweet|
        tweet "Potatoes are the best"
    end 
```

## Takeaways

Here are some of the takeaways that I had throughout my independent study for Chatterbot:

1. Over the pass three days of week 1, I was so stressed because I still haven't picked a independent study topic to study. There were so many factors to choose from and I want to learn so much, but I wanted to select something that I was comfortable with and I'm also capable of doing. 
2. I addressed my interests to myself and I thought something to do with social media, music, or hacking would interest me, but it was difficult when it was hard to understand and focus on what you really wanted --- which was basically going along with social media; Twitter.
3. There were methods included within the github tutorial (for Chatterbot) that I found was interesting, so I decided to <a href="google.com">Google</a> those methods to grasp a better understanding of them.
