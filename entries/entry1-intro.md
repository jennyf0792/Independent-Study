# Entry 1: Introduction
### Github Tutorial Project

I searched through the links on gDocs that Mr. Mueller provided the class with to see what I wanted to independently study on my own and create a tutorial to share what I've learned. Within the first few links, I saw Twitterbot and I decided I wanted to learn more about Ruby and create an automated bot that generates tweets

## Motivation

Since I am actively on Twitter, I decided chatterbot would be nice for me because sometimes, I post random things on my feed. I thought it would be cool to have a bot to automatically generate tweet texts for me. I want to create a simple tutorial for others to understand to make what I will be making.
